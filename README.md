# Shouting Cousin

***This is a group/pair lab. Write out pseudo-code first! You'll be coding your solution in `lib/cousin.rb`.***

You have an older cousin who enjoys talking ... at a _loud_ volume. He prefers it when you talk loudly as well, and his favorite topic of conversation is his time playing in punk bands when he was younger. You always have an idea what conversations with him are going to be likeâ€”so much so that you could even write a program to predict it.

Write a `speak_to_cousin` method that accepts one argument: what you want to say to him. Whatever you say to your cousin (whatever you type in), he should respond with `HUH?!  SPEAK UP!`, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, he'll be happy to keep talking to you, and yells back, `NO, NOT SINCE 1998!`.

Need help figuring out how to use if/else statements? Check out the resources below.

### BONUS

Too easy? To make your program really believable, have your cousin shout a different year each time you run the program; maybe any year at random between 1985 and 2005. (Hint: There is a Ruby method that will generate random numbers.) 

### DOUBLE BONUS

Your cousin decided he wants to keep talking to you and won't let you leave. Change your program so that it keeps running until you shout BYE. (Hint: You will probably want to use a `while loop` to keep the program running.)

### TRIPLE BONUS

Your cousin really doesn't want you to leave! When you shout BYE, he pretends not to hear you. Change your program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row before the program will end. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to your cousin.
